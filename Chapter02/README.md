# Chapter 2: Making Decisions with Trees

This chapter will introduce you to our first supervised learning algorithm in this book - decision trees. This was picked to be introduced early on since it is a versatile and easy to understand algorithm. You will also see later on that it is used as the building block for numerous advanced algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees.

In each chapter you will learn about general machine learning and statistical concepts in parallel to the main topic of the chapter. Thus, you will get to know about data splitting, model evaluation and hyper-parameter tuning.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a very good understanding of the following topics:

- How do decision trees learn?
- What are the best ways to split your data?
- How to use cross-validation to get more reliable scores?
- What are hyper-parameters and how to tune them?
- Visualising the tree's decision boundaries.
- Using decision trees for regression.
